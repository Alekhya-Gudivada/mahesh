		He first appeared in the 1979 film Needa when he was four years old.[1] He continued to perform as a child actor in several films, most of which featured his father Krishna.[2] Following his role as the titular protagonist in Balachandrudu (1990) while still a child, his career went on hiatus so he could concentrate on his education until taking on his first lead role as an adult in the 1999 film Rajakumarudu, for which he won the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[3][4] Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame.[2][5] In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh-directed action-thriller Pokiri. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time,[6][7] and according to Vogue India, cemented Babu's reputation as a "superstar".[8]

In the wake of the failures of Sainikudu (2006) and Athidhi (2007), Babu took a long-term break from cinema for personal reasons.[8][9] His next project, the fantasy action film Khaleja, was released in 2010 after significant delays.[10] 
In 2011, he starred in Dookudu, which became the first Telugu film to gross over ₹1 billion.[11] Businessman (2012), his next film, was well received and became one of the year's highest grossing Telugu films at a time that was particularly harsh on other big-budget productions.[12][13] The following year, Babu co-starred alongside Venkatesh in the critically and commercially acclaimed drama film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,[14] which was considered the first Telugu multi-starrer in decades.[15][16] He then featured in Sukumar's 2014 psychological thriller film 1: Nenokkadine.[17] Although Babu's performance as a schizophrenic rock star was lauded by critics, the film itself received mixed reviews and failed to recover its budget.[18][19] Aagadu, his next release that year, suffered a similar fate,[20][21] despite the film's opening gross being his highest at the time.[22]

His 2015 action-drama Srimanthudu was a commercial success and earned Babu his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu as well as his eighth Nandi Award in any category, the most by any individual.[23][24][25] The film was also his first as a producer.[26] His subsequent film Brahmotsavam (2016) and his first bilingual film Spyder (2017) under-performed at the box office.[27][28] The actor's next role was as an inexperienced chief minister in Koratala Siva's Bharat Ane Nenu (2018).[29] The film was the year's second highest-grossing Telugu production and critics praised Babu's performance.[30][8] His following two films, Vamshi Paidipally's action-drama Maharshi (2019) and Anil Ravipudi's action-comedy Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020), also made substantial profits despite receiving mixed reception.[31][32][33].Produced on a budget of ₹75 crore upon release, it received praise for its humor, performances, cinematography, and action sequences, but criticism aimed at screenplay, story and excessive length, and the film was commercially successful grossing more than ₹260 crore worldwide becoming the second highest grossing Telugu movie of 2020. According to box-office tracking portal Box Office Mojo, the film has grossed US$37.38 million worldwide.[34] Babu's 2022 film Sarkaru Vaari Paata also received a mixed response, however, his performance was appreciated by critics.[35] Sarkaru Vaari Paata grossed ₹180 crores worldwide in its theatrical run and became the third highest-grossing Telugu film of 2022.[36] In 2024, Babu reunited with Trivikram Srinivas for their third collaboration in the film Guntur Kaaram. The movie received a mixed response from critics as well as the audience while Mahesh stole the show in the action drama. Guntur Kaaram collected a gross of ₹46 crore (US$5.5 million) in India and ₹94 crore worldwide on its opening day. It's estimated total end worldwide gross is ₹171.50 crore.[37]

		Mahesh Babu established, "Mahesh Babu Foundation", to improve the lives of underprivileged children and communities. The foundation primarily focuses on supporting children in need by funding life-saving congenital heart surgeries. The foundation also co-runs the charitable trust and non-profit organisation "Heal A Child" in collaboration with Andhra Hospitals and Rainbow Hospitals.[7] It also recognises the importance of education and provides scholarships to meritorious students from underprivileged backgrounds. Recognizing the need for holistic development, the Mahesh Babu Foundation adopted two villages, Burripalem in Andhra Pradesh and Siddhapuram in Telangana. In these villages, the foundation has undertaken various initiatives to improve the quality of life, including constructing schools, Anganwadi buildings, libraries, roads, and drainage systems. Additionally, they have established computer labs to equip villagers with crucial digital skills. The foundation also conducts regular medical checkups, distributes medicines to those in need, and has fully vaccinated the entire population of the adopted villages against COVID-19. Through health awareness programs, the foundation strives to empower villagers to make informed decisions about their well-being.[103]

Babu has also supported AIG Hospitals' "End Corona Campaign", which was aimed at creating awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine.[104] It was one of the world's largest virtual awareness campaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine.[105]

He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment.[106] Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[107] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[108] In October 2014, he donated ₹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud.[109]
